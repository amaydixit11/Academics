    "# Problem 2: Reservoir Distribution with Valves\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given 3 reservoirs connected in a mesh topology by bidirectional valves.  \n",
    "Each reservoir has an initial amount of water and a target amount it must reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Water transfers happen by opening a valve between two reservoirs. When a valve is open, water flows until:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The destination reservoir is **full**, OR  \n",
    "- The source reservoir reaches the **safety threshold** (≥20% of its total capacity).  \n",
    "\n",
    "At most **one valve** can be opened at a time. The total amount of water is conserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to determine the **sequence of valve operations** that transforms the initial distribution into the target distribution, while **minimizing the number of valve openings**.\n",

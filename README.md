# Academic Work Archive

This repository is a structured archive of coursework, lab assignments, exams, notes, datasets, and small academic projects completed during my B.Tech in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence at IIT Bhilai.

The goal of this repository is documentation and reference — helping track progress across semesters while serving as a useful resource for revision and portfolio purposes.
